## ESPhome Deye batteries

### Prerequisites 
  - ESP32 
  - MCP2515 


#### We run two CAN cables
 - PCS which gives array summary information (we use a RJ45 splitter so that the inverter maintains communication with the top computer BMS)
 - InterCAN which gives more specific information like cell voltages
